I want to give a special shoutout to the sponsor of this competiton and a previous professor of mine, Sanjeev Kumar. Sanjeev's course "Advanced Analytics for Management Consulting" was my first introduction to data science and AI/ML, and Sanjeev's passion for the topic inspired me to want to continue a career down a similar path. Thank you professor!
